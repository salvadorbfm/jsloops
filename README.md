# JSLoops
JSLoops is a simple handler for generating audio loops with "live programming". This project is intended to work just in the browser and for now doesn't have any real purpose that just having fun. This work is based on the great project [liv3c0der](https://github.com/halfbyte/liv3c0der/).
